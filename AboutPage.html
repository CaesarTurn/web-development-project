    About
      <p align="center"; style="font-size: 25px";> This Website is for learning how to construct your own website using "Github". 
        My website was constructed using basic html and css coding to create the basis for my simple website. 
        Using Github can be challenging for new users such as myself with navigating the website but, after becoming comfortable all the features become very useful.  </p>
